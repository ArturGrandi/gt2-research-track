# GT 2.0 — Scope and Non-Goals

## Scope (what GT 2.0 is about)
GT 2.0 studies institutional acceptability of formally constrained economic systems without making them institutionally controllable.

GT 2.0 focuses on:
- institutional interfaces as system boundaries
- verifiability limits outside laboratory conditions
- governance displacement: verification-first instead of voting
- system class taxonomy and failure modes
- ethics of research-to-deployment transitions (including decision to stop)

## Non-goals (explicit exclusions)
GT 2.0 will NOT:
- define a production protocol
- write or ship executable code
- propose token issuance, tokenomics, markets, or incentives
- design governance voting systems, DAOs, or political processes
- publish a deployment roadmap or adoption strategy
- frame the work as an investment opportunity

## Interpretation guardrails
- GT 2.0 is non-canonical: it does not modify or reinterpret GT 1.0.
- GT 2.0 may conclude with “Stop” as a valid outcome.
