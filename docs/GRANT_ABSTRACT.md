# GT 2.0 — One-page Grant Abstract (research-only)

## Title
Time as a Non-Monetary Economic Primitive: Research-Only Architecture, Invariants, and Verifiability Surfaces

## Problem
Modern economic and digital systems treat value primarily as monetary, transferable, and market-mediated.
This makes certain classes of coordination and human-time accounting either invisible or forced into token-like assets,
creating category confusion and extractive dynamics.

## Approach
GT 2.0 is a research-only architecture track that formalizes:
- hard boundaries (what the protocol must never do),
- economic invariants (what must never happen),
- verifiability surfaces (what can be externally checked without deployment),
- failure-mode containment (what is a correctness issue vs a containment/cost issue),
- non-transferability semantics and disallowed transfer-surrogates,
- anti-pyramid temporal constraints (no structural early-entrant advantage from time accumulation alone).

## Contribution (what is new)
- A spec-first, no-code, non-canonical research framework for “time as unit of account”
  with explicit non-goals and non-normative clarifications.
- A structured axis-based decomposition (AXIS_A…AXIS_G) designed for external critique.
- A registry-style invariant format to enable later controlled reference verification.

## Why now
AI-era systems amplify coordination at scale while increasing risks of identity rent-seeking, sybil pressure,
and extractive incentive layering. A research-grade boundary + invariant approach is needed before any implementation work.

## Deliverables
- Public research repository with axes and appendices.
- External review intake and classification by axis.
- Follow-on: controlled reference implementation (separate phase), only after external critique.

## Non-claims
This is not a product, not an investment offering, and does not promise profitability, liquidity, or redemption.
