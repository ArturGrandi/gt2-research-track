# GT 2.0 — Repository Readiness (external reading)

Status: Research-only · Non-canonical · Spec-first · Verification-first · No-code

This repository is a research track for GT 2.0.
It contains non-normative clarifications and research constraints.
It is not a product, not tokenomics, not an investment proposal, and not a deployment plan.

## What is done (current readiness)

- Research axes AXIS_A … AXIS_G are present and filled with GT 2.0 non-normative clarifications.
- Appendix artifacts exist under /appendices (registry and research appendices).
- GT 1.0 is explicitly treated as frozen and not modified by GT 2.0.
- Failure-mode framing is explicit: containment vs correctness; no retroactive reinterpretation.

## What reviewers can validate now (without any implementation)

- Boundary correctness: what is in-scope vs out-of-scope (non-goals honored).
- Internal consistency across axes (no semantic contradictions).
- “No retroactive harm” constraints and phase-transition boundaries.
- Verifiability surfaces: what could be checked later in a controlled reference implementation.
- Determinism of any added formalization (no “interpretation ranges”).

## What is intentionally NOT in this repo

- Executable code, contracts, or UI.
- Token mechanics, market incentives, “returns”, liquidity promises, or investment framing.
- Governance / voting design.
- Identity-provider selection, biometric methods, or personal-data storage.

## What remains (next work items)

- External review intake: collect critical comments and classify them by axis.
- Grant packaging: stable one-page abstract + bibliography pointers (non-promotional).
- Controlled reference implementation planning (separate repo / separate phase), only after external comments.

## External research references
