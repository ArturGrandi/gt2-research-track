# Outreach channels (reviewers + developers) — no compensation implied

Goal: find external reviewers and potential collaborators for critique and later implementation work,
without implying payment, employment, or investment.

## A) Technical reviewers (protocols, formal methods, security)

- Formal methods communities:
  - TLA+, Alloy, Coq/Lean, model checking, protocol verification circles
- Blockchain security researchers (failure modes, containment, invariants)
- Systems researchers (distributed systems, mechanism boundaries)

Where to look (practical places):
- GitHub: contributors to formal-spec repos; verification tooling maintainers
- Academic mailing lists / lab pages: distributed systems, security, formal verification
- Workshops / reading groups: formal methods, mechanism design, crypto-econ safety

## B) Economics / mechanism-design reviewers (non-token framing)

- Economic design / mechanism design researchers
- Political economy / institutional analysis (non-state systems boundaries)
- Computational social science / coordination research

Where to look:
- SSRN/ArXiv authors in mechanism design / institutional economics
- University seminar series pages (invite for critique)
- Substack / Medium analytical writers who publish critical commentary (non-promotional)

## C) Developers for later phases (smart contracts + chat UI)

Important: GT 2.0 is no-code. Development is a later phase.
We can still identify interest now.

Smart contracts:
- protocol engineers with audit background
- deterministic arithmetic / fixed-point math experience

Chat UI (reference-only):
- frontend engineers (React/Next) with wallet / identity-adjacent UI experience
- conversational UI builders (but not implying an “AI governance layer”)

Where to look:
- Open-source contributors to wallet UIs, identity primitives, or spec-first protocol repos
- Developer communities: Ethereum Magicians, protocol engineering groups, security Discords
- Hackathon alumni lists (as reviewers first, builders later)

## D) Outreach message constraints (must keep)

- “Research-only, non-canonical, no-code” clearly stated.
- No tokenomics, no investment framing, no promises.
- Ask for critique, not endorsement.
- Make it easy: point to HOW_TO_REVIEW.md and GT2_STATUS.md.
