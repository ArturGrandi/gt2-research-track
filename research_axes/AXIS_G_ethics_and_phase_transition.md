# AXIS G — Ethics, Phase Transitions & Research Duty

## Purpose
Define obligations and disclosure thresholds during transitions from research to any applied phase, including the right to stop.

## Input questions
- Q9

## What this axis is NOT
- Not an investment framework
- Not a promise to deploy

## Core tensions
- duty to early participants vs research uncertainty
- explicit transition vs silent drift
- stop as a valid outcome

## Required outputs
- Phase transition checklist (research → applied)
- Disclosure thresholds and timing rules
- Ethical termination rules (what happens if flawed)

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- “No silent phase transitions” stated explicitly
- Stop outcome is operationally defined

## G.1 — Ethical Boundary & Non-Moralizing Constraint (GT 2.0, non-normative)

This section defines the ethical boundary of the protocol as an architectural system,
not as a moral, political, or social authority.

It does **not**:
- impose moral judgments,
- encode social preferences,
- rank or evaluate human behavior,
- enforce ethical compliance.

It does **not** modify GT 1.0 formulas, parameters, issuance rules, or economic invariants.

### Ethical neutrality principle

The protocol treats all biologically verified humans as:
- economically equivalent at the unit-definition level;
- ethically opaque to the system.

No claims, actions, or participation patterns are interpreted as:
- virtuous or non-virtuous;
- deserving or undeserving;
- compliant or non-compliant.

Ethical interpretation is strictly external to the protocol.

### Non-intervention constraint

The protocol MUST NOT:
- reward behavior based on ethical, social, or political alignment;
- penalize participation based on perceived misuse, inactivity, or non-participation;
- introduce corrective mechanisms justified by moral reasoning.

Any ethical frameworks, narratives, or value judgments exist only at the application,
community, or social layer — never at the protocol layer.

## G.2 — Phase Transition Boundary (GT 2.0, non-normative)

This section clarifies how transitions between research, deployment,
and post-decentralization phases are framed.

It does **not** define:
- a roadmap,
- a timeline,
- a commitment to deploy,
- an obligation to decentralize.

### Phase separation principle

The protocol explicitly distinguishes between:

- **Research phase**  
  Architectural exploration, clarification of boundaries, identification of failure modes.

- **Deployment phase (if any)**  
  External to GT 2.0 scope. No guarantees or commitments implied.

- **Post-decentralization phase**  
  Entirely out of scope for GT 2.0 and reserved for future research.

GT 2.0 does not assume that later phases will occur.

### No implied inevitability

The existence of GT 2.0 research artifacts MUST NOT be interpreted as:
- inevitability of deployment;
- endorsement of implementation;
- expectation of adoption or transition.

Failure to transition phases is a valid and acceptable outcome.

### Ethical stability across phases

No phase transition may retroactively:
- alter prior claims;
- reinterpret historical protocol behavior;
- impose new ethical constraints on past participation.

Ethical or governance changes, if any, apply only prospectively
and only through explicitly defined future systems.
