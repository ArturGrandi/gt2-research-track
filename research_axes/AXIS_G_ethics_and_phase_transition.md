# AXIS G — Ethics, Phase Transitions & Research Duty

## Purpose
Define obligations and disclosure thresholds during transitions from research to any applied phase, including the right to stop.

## Input questions
- Q9

## What this axis is NOT
- Not an investment framework
- Not a promise to deploy

## Core tensions
- duty to early participants vs research uncertainty
- explicit transition vs silent drift
- stop as a valid outcome

## Required outputs
- Phase transition checklist (research → applied)
- Disclosure thresholds and timing rules
- Ethical termination rules (what happens if flawed)

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- “No silent phase transitions” stated explicitly
- Stop outcome is operationally defined
