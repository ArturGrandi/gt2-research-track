# AXIS C — Economic Invariants & Verifiability

## Purpose
Define what must NEVER happen (hard invariants), and what can be verified without a full implementation.

## Input questions
- Q3
- Q10

## What this axis is NOT
- Not hiding the formula behind “rigor”
- Not requiring deployment to validate claims

## Core tensions
- disclosure vs proprietary constraints
- verifiability surfaces vs full transparency
- safety bounds vs incentive opacity

## Required outputs
- Invariants registry (human-readable + testable form)
- Verifiable surfaces list (what can be checked externally)
- Risk communication protocol (how changes/risks are disclosed)

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- At least one invariant class defined
- Verifiability does not depend on deployment
