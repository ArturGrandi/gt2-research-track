# AXIS E — Verification at Scale & Sybil Containment

## Purpose
Explain why verification happens at scale without turning into a privileged rent-seeking role, and define sybil containment bounds.

## Input questions
- Q5
- Q6

## What this axis is NOT
- Not “sybil elimination”
- Not incentive token design

## Core tensions
- verification as cost vs profit
- verifier entrenchment risks
- sybil containment vs privacy/autonomy

## Required outputs
- Verification cost model (who bears cost and why)
- Anti-entrenchment constraints (why verifiers cannot block change)
- Sybil attack surface bounds (what is prevented vs what is tolerated)

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- Explicit statement: containment ≠ elimination
- Entrenchment risk is named and bounded
