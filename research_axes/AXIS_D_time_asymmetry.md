# AXIS D — Temporal Asymmetry & Anti-Pyramid Structure

## Purpose
Study whether time-based accumulation structurally advantages early participants and how to avoid pyramid-like extraction dynamics.

## Input questions
- Q4

## What this axis is NOT
- Not a promise of “fairness”
- Not redistribution policy

## Core tensions
- early accumulation vs late participation value
- accumulation vs extraction
- continuity without decay/redistribution/voting

## Required outputs
- Formal anti-pyramid argument outline
- Definition of “late-joiner value” in non-monetary terms
- Failure modes: when the model becomes extractive

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- Extraction vs accumulation distinguished
- Failure modes stated explicitly
