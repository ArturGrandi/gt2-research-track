# AXIS D — Temporal Asymmetry & Anti-Pyramid Structure

## Purpose
Study whether time-based accumulation structurally advantages early participants and how to avoid pyramid-like extraction dynamics.

## Input questions
- Q4

## What this axis is NOT
- Not a promise of “fairness”
- Not redistribution policy

## Core tensions
- early accumulation vs late participation value
- accumulation vs extraction
- continuity without decay/redistribution/voting

## Required outputs
- Formal anti-pyramid argument outline
- Definition of “late-joiner value” in non-monetary terms
- Failure modes: when the model becomes extractive

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- Extraction vs accumulation distinguished
- Failure modes stated explicitly

---

## D.1 — Anti-Pyramid Constraint (GT 2.0, non-normative)

This section provides a research-only clarification of temporal asymmetry handling.
It does **not** introduce redistribution, decay, voting, or late-joiner compensation.
It does **not** modify GT 1.0 formulas, parameters, or issuance rules.

### Core constraint

The protocol MUST NOT structurally advantage early participants through
time-based accumulation alone.

Specifically:
- earlier participation MAY result in earlier individualization of time,
- but MUST NOT enable extraction from later participants,
- and MUST NOT cause a decreasing marginal value of time for late joiners.

### Temporal asymmetry boundary

Time-based accumulation is permitted only under the following boundary:

- accumulation reflects *lived time*, not *entry time*;
- claims are normalized against conservative demographic parameters;
- no fixed-supply pool is allocated to early cohorts;
- no transfer or delegation allows early participants to monetize later entrants.

### Failure mode definition (extractive pattern)

The model is considered **extractive** (and thus invalid under AXIS D) if:

- late participation systematically yields lower proportional entitlement
  solely due to prior accumulation by earlier participants; or
- earlier participants gain transferable leverage over future claimants; or
- protocol incentives create pressure to join early to avoid dilution.

### Non-goals

This axis does NOT:
- guarantee equality of outcomes;
- enforce temporal symmetry;
- introduce clawbacks, redistribution, or decay.

It only defines a **hard boundary** between accumulation and extraction.
