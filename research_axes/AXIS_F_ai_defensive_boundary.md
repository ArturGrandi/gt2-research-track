# AXIS F — AI Role & Defensive Boundaries

## Purpose
Define AI as strictly defensive tooling and prevent AI from becoming an implicit authority layer.

## Input questions
- Q8

## What this axis is NOT
- Not AI-based governance
- Not AI deciding value, allocation, or measurement

## Core tensions
- “defensive” vs “authoritative”
- detection vs decision
- auditability vs opacity

## Required outputs
- AI capability whitelist (allowed classes of functions)
- Defensive/authoritative separation rules
- Auditability requirements for AI tooling

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- AI cannot change outcomes directly
- AI outputs are non-authoritative signals
