# AXIS B — Units, Non-transferability & Market Surrogates

## Purpose
Clarify how non-transferable units differ from bearer assets, and what can/cannot be prevented regarding off-protocol markets and surrogates.

## Input questions
- Q2

## What this axis is NOT
- Not “enforcing no markets”
- Not token issuance / tokenomics

## Core tensions
- unit semantics vs tradeable value
- account control vs non-transferability claims
- structural limits of enforcement

## Required outputs
- Formal unit taxonomy (accounting vs bearer asset)
- Explicit statement about off-protocol markets (allowed to exist; no guarantees)
- Bounded claims: what the system can prove vs what it cannot

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- Non-transferability defined structurally
- Enforcement limits stated explicitly
