# AXIS A — Genesis & Authorial Constraints

## Purpose
Study how genesis parameters and authorial choices can be institutionally acceptable without creating permanent control by the formula designer.

## Input questions (from external review)
- Q1
- Q7

## What this axis is NOT
- Not a governance design proposal
- Not a deployment plan
- Not tokenomics

## Core tensions
- immutable rules vs permanent author control
- “absence of voting” vs “dictatorship of the formula”
- disclosed constraints vs implicit privileges

## Required outputs (research artifacts)
- Genesis declaration template
- Author participation / disclosure constraints
- Research → deployment transition rules (non-market)
- End-of-research / sunset / handoff conditions (if any)

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- Scope is explicit
- No solution proposals
- No overlap with other axes
