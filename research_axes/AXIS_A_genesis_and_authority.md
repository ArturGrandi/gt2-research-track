# AXIS A — Genesis & Authorial Constraints

## Purpose
Study how genesis parameters and authorial choices can be institutionally acceptable without creating permanent control by the formula designer.

## Input questions (from external review)
- Q1
- Q7

## What this axis is NOT
- Not a governance design proposal
- Not a deployment plan
- Not tokenomics

## Core tensions
- immutable rules vs permanent author control
- “absence of voting” vs “dictatorship of the formula”
- disclosed constraints vs implicit privileges

## Required outputs (research artifacts)
- Genesis declaration template
- Author participation / disclosure constraints
- Research → deployment transition rules (non-market)
- End-of-research / sunset / handoff conditions (if any)

## Pass condition for this axis (GT2-2)
- Scope is explicit
- No solution proposals
- No overlap with other axes
## A.x — Genesis Parameter Clarification (GT 2.0, non-normative)

This section provides a non-normative clarification of genesis-related assumptions
used in GT 2.0 research discussions. It does not modify, reinterpret, or extend
any GT 1.0 formulas, parameters, or economic invariants.

### Non-reliance on historical day-counts

The protocol does NOT rely on any fixed historical day-counts (e.g. “3333 days”).
Any such values used during early experimentation are explicitly non-protocol
and have no semantic role in GT 2.0.

### Initial Time Safe reserve derivation (conceptual)

For GT 2.0 research purposes, initial Time Safe reserve discussions may reference
the following conceptual inputs:

- statistical population size (`N_stat`);
- a reference lifespan expressed in days (`L_ref_days`);
- a global daily time accrual rate.

No numeric values are fixed or hardcoded in GT 2.0.

### Reference lifespan parameter (`L_ref_days`)

`L_ref_days` is treated as a conservative upper-bound parameter derived from
regions with the highest observed average lifespan.

This parameter is:

- set at deployment;
- monotonic (non-decreasing);
- subject to at most annual updates prior to decentralization.

Post-decentralization behavior of this parameter is explicitly out of scope
for GT 2.0 and reserved for future research.

### Scope boundaries

This clarification:

- introduces no new formulas;
- introduces no protocol commitments;
- establishes no linkage to project start dates or experimental history;
- has no semantic overlap with GT 1.0 definitions.
