## Questions (verbatim)

1. Who set the genesis parameters, what do they personally gain from those specific choices, and under what process were these parameters determined? If the formula designer or early team members participate in the protocol, under what constraints and with what disclosure?

2. You claim time units are “non-transferable” and “non-monetary” but they clearly confer differential benefits based on accumulation. How are they functionally different from tokens? What prevents secondary markets where people trade accounts, access rights, or other proxies for time credits? How is non-transferability enforced when participants control their own keys?

3. What are the economic invariants—the absolute boundaries of what can NEVER happen regardless of participant behavior? What are the specific parameter ranges (min/max values) for core formula variables? Which behaviors are structurally favored by the formula, and are these biases intentional or emergent? Without seeing the actual formula, how can anyone verify the system is operating correctly?

4. Time-based systems inherently favor early participants who have more time to accumulate. What mechanisms prevent this from collapsing into pyramid dynamics where early participants extract value from later ones? What specific value do late joiners receive that compensates for their structural disadvantage? Do time credits decay, redistribute, or accumulate forever?

5. You state verification can be “performed opportunistically, automatically, or as a secondary function of participation” and is “decoupled from participation incentives.” If verifiers receive no compensation, why would anyone verify at scale? If they DO receive compensation (even non-monetary benefits like priority, status, or time credits), what prevents validator entrenchment where early verifiers resist changes that threaten their position?

6. How do you prevent Sybil attacks where one entity operates multiple identities to accumulate disproportionate time credits? What prevents time-credit wash trading or gaming of the “engagement” metrics through which time units accrue? What specific design constraints limit extractive speculation while preserving legitimate coordination?

7. You frame “absence of voting” as a feature that prevents capture, but this just means whoever wrote the formula has permanent, unmodifiable control. How is formula-designer dictatorship different from governance capture? When does the research phase end and who decides? What mechanism exists to fix emergent exploits if the system is truly governance-free post-deployment?

8. You claim AI is “strictly limited to defensive functions such as anomaly detection” and “does not participate in value formation, measurement, or decision-making.” Who decides what counts as “defensive” versus “authoritative”? Who audits the AI systems to ensure they aren’t making implicit economic decisions? What prevents the formula designer from using AI systems to optimize their own position before others understand the rules?

9. You explicitly disclaim this is “not an investment vehicle” and is “research-only.” What are the ethical obligations to early participants if/when research findings suggest the model is extractive or flawed? If this transitions from research to production, what are the explicit criteria and disclosure requirements? What happens to early “researchers” who may become de facto pre-sale investors?

10. What specific information can you disclose NOW about formula invariants, safety bounds, and design biases even if full implementation details remain proprietary? How do you plan to communicate discoveries about systemic risks, phase transitions, or parameter updates to all participants? Without this transparency, how do you distinguish “formula-constrained rigor” from “hiding the incentive structure”?
