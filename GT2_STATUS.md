# GT 2.0 — Status

Status: Research-only · Non-canonical · Verification-first · No-code

Start date: 2026-01-26  
Current stage: GT2-2 (Axes formalization)  
Baseline rule: GT 1.0 remains frozen and is not modified by GT 2.0.

## Hard constraints (must remain true)
- No executable code in this repository
- No token mechanics, market incentives, or investment framing
- No governance voting design
- No normative references from GT 1.0 to GT 2.0

Definition of Done
- docs/GT2_DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md
- All GT 2.0 progression is gated by this document
  
## Active research axes
- AXIS_A — Genesis & authority constraints
- AXIS_B — Units, non-transferability & market surrogates
- AXIS_C — Economic invariants & verifiability
- AXIS_D — Temporal asymmetry & anti-pyramid structure
- AXIS_E — Verification at scale & Sybil containment
- AXIS_F — AI defensive boundary
- AXIS_G — Ethics, phase transitions & research duty
  
## Axes lock
Research axes AXIS_A through AXIS_G are fixed.
No new axes may be introduced without revising this status file.

## External inputs anchored
- reviews/external_critical_review_A.md (anonymized)

## Next allowed action
- Create and fill AXIS_A … AXIS_G files using the shared template

## Status — February 2026

GT 2.0 is complete as a **research-only architectural framework**.

All research axes (A–G) have been finalized, including:
- genesis and authority boundaries;
- unit semantics and non-transferability constraints;
- economic invariants and verifiability;
- temporal asymmetry and anti-pyramid structure;
- verification at scale and sybil containment;
- AI defensive boundaries;
- ethics, phase transitions, and research duty.

GT 2.0 introduces **no new formulas**, **no protocol commitments**, and **no economic guarantees**.
It does not modify, override, or reinterpret any GT 1.0 formulas, parameters, or invariants.

No deployment, governance, tokenization, monetization, or automation is implied.

This repository represents a **closed research phase**, intended for:
- architectural review,
- critical analysis,
- academic or technical discussion.

Any future system, deployment, or governance model—if ever pursued—must be specified as a separate system with explicitly defined assumptions.
