# GT 2.0 — Status

Status: Research-only · Non-canonical · Verification-first · No-code

Start date: 2026-01-26  
Current stage: GT2-2 (Axes formalization)  
Baseline rule: GT 1.0 remains frozen and is not modified by GT 2.0.

## Hard constraints (must remain true)
- No executable code in this repository
- No token mechanics, market incentives, or investment framing
- No governance voting design
- No normative references from GT 1.0 to GT 2.0

- AXIS_A — Genesis & authority constraints
- AXIS_B — Units, non-transferability & market surrogates
- AXIS_C — Economic invariants & verifiability
- AXIS_D — Temporal asymmetry & anti-pyramid structure
- AXIS_E — Verification at scale & Sybil containment
- AXIS_F — AI defensive boundary
- AXIS_G — Ethics, phase transitions & research duty

## External inputs anchored
- reviews/external_critical_review_A.md (anonymized)

## Next allowed action
- Create and fill AXIS_A … AXIS_G files using the shared template
