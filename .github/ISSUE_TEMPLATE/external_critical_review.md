about: Request for independent critical review of GT 2.0 research architecture

## Scope of this review

This repository represents **GT 2.0**, a **research-only architectural framework**.

This issue is intended **exclusively** for:
- identification of logical inconsistencies;
- violated invariants;
- internal contradictions;
- undefined or underspecified assumptions;
- claims that cannot be formally supported.

This is **not** a request for:
- feature suggestions;
- protocol improvements;
- tokenomics or economic proposals;
- implementation advice;
- product or UX feedback.

---

## Hard constraints (non-negotiable)

- **GT 1.0 is frozen** and out of scope.
- No edits to GT 1.0 specifications, formulas, parameters, or wording.
- GT 2.0 is **non-normative** and introduces **no economic guarantees**.
- No new axes, tokens, or protocol commitments may be proposed here.

---

## What to review

You may focus on:
- consistency between research axes (AXIS A–G);
- coherence of stated invariants;
- boundary conditions and failure modes;
- assumptions about time, identity, and accounting;
- internal logical closure of the architecture.

---

## How to structure your feedback

Please structure your review using the following format:

1. **Claim / Assumption under review**
2. **Why it fails or is questionable**
3. **Where it appears (file / section)**
4. **Whether this is a logical, mathematical, or architectural issue**

Concise and technical feedback is preferred.
