# Grand Time — GT 2.0 (Research Track)

Status: Research-only · Exploratory · Non-canonical · No-code

GT 2.0 is a research track exploring the institutional acceptability of formally constrained economic systems:

> What conditions make formally constrained economic systems
> institutionally acceptable without making them institutionally controllable?

This repository does **not** define a production protocol, deployment plan, or investment framework.

## Relationship to GT 1.0

GT 2.0 builds conceptually on the verified baseline established in GT 1.0.

GT 1.0 remains **frozen, authoritative, and unchanged**.
No GT 2.0 material is normative for GT 1.0.

## What this repo contains

- Research axes (A–G) mapping external critical questions into structured research dimensions
- An anonymized external critical review (input artifact)
- Appendices for invariants registry, threat model, and disclosure protocol
- Scope and non-goals (explicit exclusions)

## What this repo explicitly does NOT contain

- Production code
- Tokenomics / markets
- Governance voting design
- Investment narratives
- Deployment roadmap

## AI assistance

AI tools are used strictly as drafting and structuring assistants under explicit human direction.
They do not define research questions, introduce new research axes, determine conclusions,
or author normative content.

All architectural decisions, scope boundaries, and final texts are human-authored,
reviewed, and approved.

## Current inputs

- One anonymized external critical review (10 questions) used as a boundary anchor for GT 2.0.
